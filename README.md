# ðŸ“Š EDA on Customer Bookings (Python)

This is a portfolio project showcasing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on a simulated customer bookings dataset.

## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Created a sample dataset with user ID, product, channel, region, revenue, and booking dates
- Used Pandas to explore revenue trends, user behavior, and time-based patterns
- Identified top regions, channels, and customers by revenue
- Detected anomalies using rolling averages

## Files Included
- `EDA_Bookings_Analysis.ipynb` â€” Python notebook with full analysis
- *(More coming soon: SQL queries and Power BI dashboard)*

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- GitHub for version control

## Highlights
- Revenue by Region: North leads with highest bookings
- Weekday vs Weekend: Clear difference in booking behavior
- Channel-wise Performance: Compared Online vs Store
- Top Customers: Identified high-value repeat users
- Anomaly Detection: Flagged revenue dips below rolling average

> This project is still in progress. SQL & Power BI coming next.
> Built for interview prep, portfolio proof, and skill sharpening.
